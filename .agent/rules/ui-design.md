# UI Design Rules

- **Reference Design Files**: Always use the design files located in the `design/` folder as the primary reference for all UI/UX implementations, new screen designs, and component styling.
- **Aesthetic Consistency**: Analyze any HTML, CSS, images, or documentation in the `design/` folder to ensure that Flutter widgets, colors, typography, and layouts are perfectly aligned with the provided designs.
- **Pre-Implementation Check**: Before starting any UI-related task, the first step MUST be to check the `design/` folder for relevant mockups or templates.
- **Premium Design Standards**: Following the project's "Clean, minimal, premium aesthetic" (as defined in `openspec/project.md`), use the design files to achieve a high-quality, professional look.
